# Development status

Single state file for the pyflightstream repository. Updated at every
session close (see the Session protocol in CLAUDE.md). Seeded 2026-07-21.

The design documents (SRS, SAD, Bootstrap Kit) live locally in
`_private/design/` and never enter Git. Their canonical versions live in
the author's research workspace. Public contributors rely on CLAUDE.md,
CONTRIBUTING.md, and the docs.

## Milestones

Milestone map per the Bootstrap Kit (`_private/design/DLV-004`, Section 7).

| Milestone | Content | Exit criterion | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| M0 | Repo skeleton, pyproject, CI, pre-commit, CLAUDE.md, guards | CI green on empty package | Done 2026-07-21 (root commit acc0e0e, CI green) |
| M1 | `versions.py` (26.XXX scheme), database schema, loader, `_meta.yaml`, ~40 core steady commands with citations | Tier 1 database tests pass | Next |
| M2 | Script builder with phase ordering, helpers, `files/` layout, local executor, campaign loop, manifest, loads parser, goldens, legacy matrix reader | End-to-end dry run plus one real local run | Planned |
| M3 | Tier 2 probe harness, first compat report for 26.120, apply-compat | Committed compat report; statuses promoted | Planned |
| M4 | PHY-01/02 plus version-comparison suite (synthetic committed, SMI local) | Committed physics report | Planned |
| M5 | mkdocs site, command reference and compatibility matrix generated from the database, steady polar example | Docs build strict; example runs | Planned |
| v0.1.0 | Tag, private | All above green | Planned |
| v0.2+ | Remaining PHY cases, 26.000/26.100 backfill probing, declarative matrix successor, public release, PyPI | Public checklist (invariants audit) passes | Planned |

## Current focus

M1. Single next action: draft `versions.py` (26.XXX scheme, ordered
registry, aliases), then the database schema and loader, then the first
~40 core steady commands from the manual with page citations.

## Open questions

| Question | Waiting on |
|---|---|
| xarray as a runtime dependency behind the `ResultArray` facade | Geovana's confirmation at M2 (SAD Section 9; noted in `pyproject.toml`) |
| Whether to genericize the SMI name in the repository (currently kept, required by the version-comparison case design) | Open option, Geovana's decision |
| Persistent `gh auth login` (browser flow); today repo-scoped gh calls export GH_TOKEN via `git credential fill` | Optional, Geovana |

## Recorded deviations

* `mkdocs.yml` sits at the repository root, not under `docs/` as in the
  Bootstrap Kit tree, because mkdocs requires the config file outside
  `docs_dir` (recorded at M0).
* Session documentation (this file, `plan.csv`, `logbook.csv`,
  `handoffs/`) is committed, by the author's decision of 2026-07-21. It
  is not part of the Bootstrap Kit tree and must satisfy the same
  guards as the rest of the repository.
