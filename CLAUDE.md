# pyflightstream

Version-aware, didactic Python driver for the FlightStream panel-method
solver. Successor of the author's legacy research scripts. MIT licensed.

## Hard invariants (never violate)

1. Never reproduce FlightStream manual text, screenshots, or example
   blocks anywhere in this repository. Manual facts appear only as
   paraphrases with a page citation (manual_ref). The manual pdf lives
   in _private/ and never enters Git.
2. Clean-room rule: the command emitter is specified only from the
   official manual and from probe evidence. Never read, quote, or
   adapt code from pyFlightscript (AGPL-3.0), including the vendored
   copy in the old research workspace.
3. Every command database change is evidence-backed: a manual_ref for
   documented entries, a committed probe report for verified/broken.
   No status is hand-edited.
4. Supported FlightStream versions are only added, never dropped.
   Canonical version identifiers use the 26.XXX three-digit scheme;
   the ordered list in commands/_meta.yaml is the only ordering
   authority.
5. No proprietary content: no employer or third-party data, no
   research geometry. SMI geometry stays in _private/ and is referenced
   only by local QA runs; committed reports carry aggregated
   coefficients only. The repository never names the author's employer
   or internal predecessor toolchains; legacy scripts are referenced
   only generically, as inspiration.
6. All folder, file, and identifier names are in English.
7. Examples are percent-format .py; .ipynb never enters Git.
8. Didactic policy: numpydoc docstrings with units and reference
   frames; module top-docstrings state the pipeline role; error
   messages name the physical or version cause.

## Engineering policy

Prefer existing public libraries over in-house implementation whenever
the need is generic (validation, parsing, arrays, IO); licenses must be
MIT-compatible. Domain logic (FlightStream semantics, evidence rules,
physics) stays in-house. Author's decision of 2026-07-21.

## Definition of done

A change is done when: tier 1 tests pass in CI; new commands carry
manual_ref, phase, layout, and typed args; new parsers have fixtures;
public functions have numpydoc docstrings; the docs build; and the
change needing solver evidence has its probe report committed or an
issue tracking the pending probe.

Documentation currency (SRS NFR-11, adopted 2026-07-22): a change to
the public surface (API, CLIs, extras, behavior, deprecations) is done
only when CHANGELOG.md's Unreleased section describes it and the
public pages it invalidates (README, docs, SRS requirement statuses)
move in the same session. Facts live in one home; version-bearing
files agree (test-enforced). The periodic `audit` skill sweeps for
drift; findings are updated or deleted, never left for later.

## Layout

src layout per the SAD. Dependencies flow downward:
versions <- commands <- script/results <- cases <- run/workspace <- post/qa.
Never import upward. (`workspace` is the renamed `files`; the old name
survives only as a deprecation shim.)

## Session protocol

Every working session starts by stating its objective against
STATUS.md, and ends with /handoff out, which writes the session
handoff under handoffs/, appends the logbook.csv row, and updates
STATUS.md. Planning lives in plan.csv via /plan. These session
documents are committed and must satisfy the same guards as the rest
of the repository. Conversation with the author may be in Portuguese;
every committed artifact is in English (invariant 6). The design
documents (SRS, SAD, Bootstrap Kit) are local-only in _private/design/.
