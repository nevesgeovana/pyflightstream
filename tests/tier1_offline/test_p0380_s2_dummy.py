"""P0380-DUMMY (FR-932 to FR-936): a grid's shared nodes become its neighbours', and components.

Every source is synthetic (tests/p0380_mesh_fixtures.py): the cambered sheet
grid ``G``; ``T``, a strip of triangles (no grid) sharing G's tip station
node for node; ``U``, a strip of triangles sharing T's last row only, so it
touches T and never G; and for FR-932 ``G2``, a second grid sharing G's tip
station, of quadrilaterals (resampled with G as one layout, PFS-2151) or of
split quadrilaterals (which joins no layout and falls back to the rule of
the first grid). Each behaviour is also run with the step it rests on
taken away or on a planted input, so a check that accepts everything cannot
pass.
