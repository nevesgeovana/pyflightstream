"""Tier 1: far-field ledger gate G0, synthetic fields with exact answers.

Every ledger equation is validated against pencil-and-paper fields
before any solver runs (DLV-006 Sec. 5): uniform flow, an analytic
actuator-disk jump, a solid-body swirl patch, and an imposed pure 1P
cosine loading. No solver, fast, deterministic.

Since 0.40.0 the ledgers take the numpy ``LatticeFields`` of
``lattice_fields``; the assertions are those of the xarray
implementation, and the bit parity of every result is held separately by
``test_p0400_farfield_numpy.py``. The rothalpy guards left with the two
functions. This checks retained numerical behavior, not the removal contract.
