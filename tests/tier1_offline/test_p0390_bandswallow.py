"""P0390-BANDSWALLOW (FR-431): a neighbour the band covers whole is rebuilt whole at factor 1.

Every source is synthetic (tests/p0380_mesh_fixtures.py): the cambered sheet
grid ``G`` with its trailing-edge points file, and ``T``, a strip of
triangles sharing G's tip station node for node. G is refined at factor 2
with T unselected, so T's curve with G changes and T is an unchanged
neighbour whose band of two face layers is remeshed (FR-425 R3). A strip of
two rows is all band: 0.38.0 cut an empty remainder from it and raised on the
trailing-edge lookup of that empty family. The control strip has four rows,
so its band leaves a remainder and the cut of FR-425 R3 stays.
