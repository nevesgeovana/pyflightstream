Pipeline role: below every layer, imported by the script layer (the wake-edge
node file) and the workspace layer (the trailing-edge points file) alike, and
the sign flip of a table cell the post layer's inflow tables share. It
imports nothing from this package, for the reason :mod:`pyflightstream._digest`
does: a helper two layers need is published beneath both, never reached for
across a boundary.
