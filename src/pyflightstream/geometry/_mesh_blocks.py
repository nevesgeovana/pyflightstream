"""Block topology, counts, carry rows and poles of the full-grid strategy (PFS-2214, strategy 2).

Pipeline role: the pure planning layer of strategy 2. The workspace mesher reads the faces of a
configuration from the kernel and hands this module only numbers: the signed edge walk of every
face with the turn at each vertex, the edge lengths, and the edges that meet on a junction. This
module then chooses the four corners of every face (a face with more than four edges becomes a
block with composite sides, which is how a junction curve replaces one side of a block, delta
F.2), solves one integer cell count per edge so that opposite sides of every block are equal
(E09), the junction ring holds its count on every side (E08) and the cell width changes by at
most ``max_growth`` from one edge to the next along a carry row (E10), splits a half-body
azimuth count over the body's sectors, and checks that every irregular node is a declared
valence 3 pole (E11) and that no cell is a triangle (E07).

The error codes and their wording are those of :data:`pyflightstream.geometry._mesh_schema.ERRORS`,
so an input refused before meshing and a realized defect read the same.
