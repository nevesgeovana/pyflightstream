"""Stage records and the run report of the geometry pipeline.

Pipeline role: pure helper of the geometry package. A stage record is the file a paper cites:
it names the package version, the identity of the inputs, and for each check its id, its
limit and the value measured. A report is what a design loop reads after a parameter set
that failed: it names the stage and the check, and it is returned, never raised.

``started`` and ``wall_s`` change from run to run and stay out of every identity; use
:func:`identity_view` to compare two records.

    why.

    Parameters
    ----------
    check_id : str
        The id of the check in the stage table, such as ``"input.valid"``.
    status : str

    measured : float, optional

    limit : float, optional
        The limit it is held to; required when the check ran.
    unit : str, optional
        The unit of ``measured`` and ``limit``.
    where : Mapping, optional
        Where the worst value sits, such as a component or a station.
    note : str, optional
        Why a skipped check was skipped; required for ``"skipped"``.
    bound : str, optional
