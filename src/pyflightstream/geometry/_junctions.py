"""The measured checks of the junction sub-steps, and the pure geometry they measure with.

Pipeline role: pure part of stage S10 of the geometry pipeline. The kernel module
:mod:`pyflightstream.workspace._geom_assembly` runs the sub-steps (load, pieces alone, the cut,
the projection, the split, the removal, the write and the sewing) and hands the numbers it
measured to the functions here, which compute distances, chains, inside tests, the flood of a
removal and the verdict of each named check. Nothing here imports a kernel.

The dominant imprints on the dominated, the dominated loses its inside, and the dominant is
split along the junction too. No area constant
decides a removal: the faces a piece keeps are those its seeds reach without crossing a junction.

Every limit below carries the sentence that says where it comes from. They are lengths of the
geometry's own tolerances (half the sewing tolerance, the reader's resolution), not values of any
aircraft.
