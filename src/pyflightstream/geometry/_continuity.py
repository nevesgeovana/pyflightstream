"""Tangent-plane jump audit across the shared edges of a patch set.

Pipeline role: pure numerical check of the geometry package (stage S9). It finds every edge that
two patches share, measures the turn of the surface across it, and compares the largest turn with
a limit. The measure needs no consistent patch orientation: it is the angle between the
cross-edge tangent of one patch and the reversed cross-edge tangent of the other, taken in the
plane perpendicular to the shared edge, so a smooth join reads 0 and a fold reads up to 180.

    ----------
