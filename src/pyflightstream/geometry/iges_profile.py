"""The IGES profile the FlightStream reader is known to accept, and what is not known.

A plain description with no kernel and no file access: :mod:`pyflightstream.workspace._geom_gate`
measures a file against it. Every value here is either observed (a file of that shape was read by
the solver) or ``None``, which means no source states a limit and a file beyond the observed shape
is warned about, never refused. Only a solid entity is refused, because the package builds
surfaces only.

Observed: non-rational, clamped, bicubic parametric surfaces (entity 128), trimmed by an outer
boundary (entities 142 and 102), each face named by a 406 form 15 property. The observed
degrees are a set per direction and the observed net size a limit, both filled from the licensed
reader probe (record ``tests/tier1_offline/data/g13p-reads.json``, build 26.127, lane G13P): the
solver read faces of degree 1, 3 and 5 in either direction, and a net of 111 by 18, from files
written by ``iges-convert``; the same probe files as the package writes them, imported directly,
read with the same areas (record ``tests/tier1_offline/data/g13d-reads.json``, lane G13D, the
P2 file of PREF 2 excepted). The direct route reads a
face only when its outer boundary has parameter-space curves flagged 2D parametric (entity use 05)
and a PREF other than 2; the writer states both, and a PREF 2 asked of it is warned about and
written as 1. No net limit is stated
because the largest net probed was not a failing one.
