"""Strategy 1 junction faces: the trimmed faces a junction curve crosses (delta F.2, PFS-2214).

Pipeline role: the kernel half of the junction block step of the strategy 1 mesher. After the
configuration is fragmented, every face of a primary component that touches the transition
component (the wing-fuselage fairing) is one block of the generated layout, each source patch
being a block bounded by the layout lines (body junction stations, azimuth sectors, wing
bays), crossed or bounded by a junction curve. The pure classifier
:func:`~pyflightstream.workspace._geometry_mesh_s1.junction_blocks` says whether the curve keeps
the block four-sided; here the face's boundary walk is measured for its corners. A face stays
structured (transfinite between four corners, a run of junction curves as one curved side) or
is meshed with the transition component, quad-dominant with sizes matched on its curves: the
fairing adapts to the fuselage grid, and quad-dominant cells stay inside it (MESH_DESIGN
section 8).
