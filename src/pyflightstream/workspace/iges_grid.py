"""Grid a named IGES assembly into one OBJ, one family per component (PFS-2198).

Each IGES file is imported into one OpenCASCADE model (the gmsh kernel) with every face
named by the NAME of its level (:mod:`pyflightstream.workspace._iges_names`). The faces are
healed and fragmented together so the edges two components share are conformal, four-sided
patches are meshed transfinite with the laws of the grid control file and recombined into quads,
and every other patch is meshed quad-dominant at its component's size
(:mod:`pyflightstream.workspace._iges_mesh`). The OBJ holds one family per component in the
order of the control file, each oriented outward; ``<out>.boundaries.toml`` is the boundaries
file ``geometry mark-boundaries`` reads, with one points file per trailing edge found; and
``<out>.json`` records the nodes, faces, quad share, least scaled Jacobian and largest aspect of
every component, the conformal check and every warning. Quality is warned with its numbers and
never refused.
