"""The CAD kernel interface of the geometry stages, with no kernel import.

A stage that builds, intersects, trims, queries or writes surfaces takes a :class:`CadKernel` and
never sees the library behind it. :mod:`pyflightstream.workspace._gmsh` is the one module that
imports a kernel library and holds the adapter; a permissive kernel replaces it by adding an adapter
that satisfies this protocol and changing :func:`pyflightstream.workspace._gmsh.open_kernel`.

Everything here is a plain type: a face is an opaque handle, points are tuples of floats in metres
(a file read in another unit arrives in metres), and a result is a frozen dataclass. The interface
is surfaces only: no method builds or returns a solid.
