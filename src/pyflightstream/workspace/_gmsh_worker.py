"""Run a geometry-kernel conversion in a disposable worker process.

The OpenCASCADE kernel behind gmsh can fault natively on a malformed surface (an access
violation), and a Python ``except`` cannot establish that the kernel is usable afterwards. So
each conversion that needs the kernel runs in a worker process of its own: the parent never
initializes gmsh for it, a fault ends only the worker, and the parent reports the failure with
its cause and goes on. A failed conversion is fatal for that conversion: no kernel state is
reused, no retry is made in the same process, and nothing is published: an operation that
names an output (``out``) writes it, and everything beside it, to a staging folder, and the
parent moves the files to their place only after the worker has answered without an error,
so a worker that is killed, times out or refuses part way leaves nothing behind.

The request and the answer travel as JSON files named on the worker's command line, never
through the standard streams, which the kernel writes to.
