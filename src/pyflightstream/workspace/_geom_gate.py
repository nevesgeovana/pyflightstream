"""The reader profile gate: measure a written IGES file against what the solver reader accepts.

Pure text work on the file, with no kernel: :func:`check_profile` reads the entities back and
reports one finding per defect. A solid entity is refused with an error, because the package
builds surfaces only. Every other defect is a ``fail`` finding that names its check and entity,
so a loop of parameter sets keeps its report. A degree beyond the observed ones, which no source
limits yet, an inner loop and a surface of revolution (120) are a ``warn``. The profile itself is
:mod:`pyflightstream.geometry.iges_profile`.

A trimmed face (144) is read from its parameter list, not from where this package writes things:
its surface, its outer boundary, its inner boundaries and its property pointers are parsed, so a
file from another system is measured by the same rules. The outer boundary (142) must close in the
parameter space of its surface, stay inside the surface's domain, and have a model-space curve
that lies on the surface within the resolution the file states.
