"""Scale an OBJ mesh uniformly about a point into a new output folder (PFS-2222).

Pipeline role: the workspace layer's geometry verb behind ``pyfs-workspace geometry scale``. Every
vertex ``p`` of the OBJ becomes ``c + factor * (p - c)`` for the scale centre ``c`` (the origin
unless ``about`` is given), a homothety: lengths grow by the factor, angles and the face
topology do not change. The file is rewritten line by line as bytes and only the three
coordinates of each ``v`` line change; face order, group and component names, normals, texture
coordinates, comments and line endings stay byte for byte, because the solver's results depend on
the face order. The scaled OBJ is written under the input's own name into an output folder the
verb creates (``<stem>_scaled<factor>`` beside the input by default), with a JSON record beside
it: the input digest, the factor, the centre, the vertex and face counts and the bounding boxes
before and after. The input is never overwritten, and an output folder that already holds a file
of that name is refused unless ``force`` is given.

    Parameters
    ----------
    mesh : str or Path
        The source OBJ or .fsm, read only.
    factor : float or str
        The uniform length multiplier, finite and above zero (text such as ``"0.5"`` is read).
    out : str or Path, optional
        The output folder, created with its parents. The scaled OBJ goes there under the input
        file name, with ``<name>.scale.json`` beside it. Default: ``<stem>_scaled<factor>``
        beside the input.
    about : str or tuple of float, optional
        The scale centre ``x,y,z``; default the origin.
    force : bool, default False
        Replace a same-name file already in the output folder instead of refusing.

    Returns
    -------
    dict
        The record also written to JSON: input name and sha256, factor, centre, output paths,
        vertex and face counts and the bounding boxes before and after.

    Raises
    ------
    InputValueError
        The factor or centre is unusable, the OBJ holds no usable vertex, or the output would
        overwrite a file without ``force``; nothing is written.
