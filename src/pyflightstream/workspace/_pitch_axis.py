"""The pitch axis of each blade from the rotor axis and a reference point (PFS-2193).

``[repitch] rotor_axis`` is the direction of the rotor's rotation and ``reference_point`` places
the pitch axes. A scalar is a coordinate along the rotor axis: it locates the plane perpendicular
to the rotor axis, and every blade's pitch axis lies in that plane, along the blade's span
direction projected on it, through the hub centre. The hub centre is the centroid of the named
hub's cut by the plane when the cut closes (a full wheel), or the centre of the circle fitted to
the cut when it is an arc (a sector); the cut crosses each blade root, so its two crossings of a
root loop are joined by a chord. A three-vector is one point for every blade.

The span direction is the principal axis of the blade's nodes, the eigenvector of their spread,
with no snap to a global axis: a snap would catch a blade lying near an axis and not its
neighbours, so the blades of a wheel would turn about lines that do not map onto each other. Its
sense is towards the tip.
