"""Remesh a hub band between two frozen loops, shared by hub-rings and repitch (PFS-2192, PFS-2196).

Both verbs take a hole of hub faces out around a blade root and fill the annulus between an inner
loop (the outer ring of ``hub-rings``, the turned root of the repitch remesh route) and the hole's
boundary: first triangulated in a chart of the hub, then remeshed quad-dominant by the remesh
``refine`` uses, both loops frozen and every free node projected on the source hub. The kept faces
keep their place and order, and each blade's new faces take the place of its first face taken,
because the solver's results depend on face order. The checks of the result live here too, so
both verbs hold their output to the source in one way: broken invariants (a kept node, face or
open edge changed, an edge over two faces, a frozen loop node moved) refuse; the quality of the
new cells is measured and returned for the verb to warn.
