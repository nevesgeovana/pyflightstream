"""The gmsh half of ``geometry iges-grid``: join the faces, set the laws, mesh, read the elements.

The faces of every component are healed and fragmented together, so an edge two faces share
becomes one curve and its nodes are shared. Four-sided patches of a structured component get
transfinite curves with the laws of the grid control file and are recombined into quads; every
other patch is meshed quad-dominant (MeshAdapt, Blossom recombination) at its component's size,
graded from any curve shorter than it. The opposite sides of a four-sided patch must take one
count, so the curves that must agree are grouped and each group takes the count of the first
component that asks; every other request in the group is recorded as overridden.
