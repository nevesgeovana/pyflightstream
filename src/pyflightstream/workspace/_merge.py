"""Merge two trimmed OBJ along the open boundaries they hold within a threshold (FR-3480).

One part is KEPT and one is ADAPTED, named by the caller. The interface is the
open-boundary chains of the two parts whose nodes lie within the threshold of
the other's chain. Nothing of the kept part changes: its nodes, their text and
order, and its faces and their order are the output's first lines. The adapted
part takes the kept part's nodes along each chain in one of two ways:

- MOVED: both chains carry one node per node within the threshold. The adapted
  nodes are replaced by the kept nodes and no face changes kind.
- CONFORMED: otherwise, a band of :data:`._refine._geometry.BAND_LAYERS` face
  layers of the adapted part is remeshed at factor 1 by
  :func:`._refine._remesh.refine_group`, with the interface rebuilt on the kept
  nodes by :meth:`._refine._remesh.Remesher.conform` and every other node of the
  band projected onto the adapted surface. A band that would hold a whole family
  rebuilds the family, warned, as a refinement does (FR-431). When the remesh cannot
  hold the kept nodes, an adapted part past one face layer over the kept one being the
  measured case, only the faces on the interface are split onto them, warned (FR-3489).

Every open edge of the two parts that is not on an interface stays open, and the
ones still facing the other part's open boundary are warned with their count. A
threshold that finds no interface warns and writes nothing.

The layer is the workspace row; the refinement package imports nothing of this
module. The remesh, and with it trimesh, scipy and rtree, is imported only when a
chain needs it, so two chains of one node per node need no extra.
