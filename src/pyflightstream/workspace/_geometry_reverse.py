"""Identifying a lifting surface from an original IGES skin (uses the gmsh kernel).

Pipeline role: the workspace row of the reverse step. A component of an IGES file (named on
its level, the 406 NAME index) is cut by planes normal to its span axis on the trimmed faces
with OpenCASCADE (Newton-corrected polylines, never bridging a missing surface); the cuts feed
the numerical stage of :mod:`pyflightstream.geometry._reverse`, which finds the clean band, the
planform between a root and the outermost clean cut and the CST sections. The root is the
plane crossing of the extended leading edge for a surface on a symmetry plane, the meeting of
the extended leading edge with a host surface for a surface on a body, or the span extent of
the original's own trimmed boundary curves for a surface open inside its host.

Nothing is repaired silently: a station that is not one closed airfoil contour is recorded
with its reason and left out of the band. The entry point and its result are
:func:`pyflightstream.workspace.geometry_pipeline.identify_lifting_surface` and
:class:`~pyflightstream.workspace.geometry_pipeline.LiftingIdentification`.
