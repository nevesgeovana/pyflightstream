"""Collapse a blunt trailing edge of named blades into one sharp line (OBJ).

A blunt trailing edge is a strip of one cell between two rims. Each pair of rim nodes joined
across the strip is merged at its midpoint, the strip faces leave, the faces that met the strip
lose their repeated node, and the two rim entries of the boundaries file become one line. Every
other node keeps its text and its place, and every other face its place and its node order,
because the solver's results depend on face order.
