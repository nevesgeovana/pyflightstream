"""Rewrite one or more named IGES files as one IGES of B-spline faces, names kept (PFS-2199).

Each file is imported into one OpenCASCADE model (the gmsh kernel), every face is
converted to a NURBS surface, and one IGES is written holding only B-spline surfaces and curves,
the form the solver's CAD import reads. Each component keeps its name: its faces sit on one level
and one 406 form 15 NAME names that level, so the solver and
:func:`pyflightstream.workspace._iges_names.read_iges_names` read the same components back. The
first file's length unit is kept and every other file is scaled to it. A compatible
single NURBS source retains its coefficients and trims, with a second native import
checking its faces and names before writing. A record
``<out>.json`` beside the output lists the faces of each component, the digest of every source,
the surface types before and after, and the read-back.
