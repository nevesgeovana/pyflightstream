"""Trailing-edge extraction from a blade surface mesh.

THE ROTOR FRAME IS WHERE THE CRITERION IS COMPUTED, NOT WHERE THE
COORDINATES LAND, and this line said otherwise until a review pass on
2026-08-20 traced two public sentences back to it. The axis and the hub
define the spanwise and tangential directions that decide which end of a
section is aft; the points returned are SELECTED MESH VERTICES and the
mid-points of MESH EDGES, never transformed, so they are in the mesh's
own reference frame and length units. A reader who believed otherwise
would apply an inverse transform before writing the points and mark the
wrong edges, which is the failure this capability exists to remove.

Pipeline role: workspace layer. It turns a surface mesh the user already
has into the trailing-edge points file a geometry names: the mid-point of
every mesh edge on the trailing edge, under a unit line
(:func:`pyflightstream.workspace.wake_edges.write_trailing_edge_points`),
which the run converts into the node file the wake-edge import reads.
The extraction is the last piece of a rotor campaign that the user had to
do by hand.

MID-POINTS, BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT THE IMPORT MATCHES (RPT-061). The import
marks an edge whose mid-point lies within its tolerance of a point in
the file, and a list of the edges' end vertices marks nothing. So
:func:`trailing_edge_midpoints` finds the EDGES: the sections below give
one aftmost vertex each, consecutive ones are joined by the shortest path
along mesh edges that are the aft ridge of both their faces, and each
edge of that path contributes its mid-point.

THE CRITERION IS NOT A CREASE, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT (design note
DD-27, decided 2026-08-20). The obvious implementation is a dihedral
angle over face adjacency, which every mesh library offers and which
this package already refuses in three places: marking wake edges from a
file exists precisely BECAUSE auto detection is an angle criterion and
"a strongly twisted blade has a trailing edge that is not a crease"
(:mod:`pyflightstream.script.helpers`). An extraction built on adjacency
angles would reimplement in Python the criterion this package moved off
the solver to escape, and a campaign would gain a different threshold
rather than a different capability.

WHAT IS COMPUTED INSTEAD. Given a surface mesh, a rotor axis and a hub
position:

1. the SPANWISE coordinate of a vertex is its distance from the rotor
   axis, measured radially from the hub and perpendicular to the axis;
2. the vertices are binned into chordwise SECTIONS by that coordinate;
3. within each section the CHORDWISE direction is taken from the
   section's own extent, never from a global axis, which is what makes
   the answer survive twist;
4. the trailing-edge node of the section is the AFTMOST vertex along
   that direction, and the node list is those vertices ordered by span;
5. for the mid-points, an interior mesh edge is a trailing-edge
   CANDIDATE when the far vertex of each of its two faces lies forward of
   it, forward meaning against the aft chord of its section with the
   edge's own direction removed. That is a question about which side of
   the edge the surface is on, in the rotor frame, and no angle is
   compared with a threshold;
6. consecutive sections' aftmost vertices are joined by the shortest
   path through candidate edges, the chain is extended past the first
   and last section along the one outward candidate edge while there is
   exactly one, and the chain's edges give the mid-points.

It needs vertices, faces and a section plane. It needs no adjacency
angle, no watertightness test and no proximity query, so it runs on a
base install with none of this package's optional extras
(``PFS-2025.20.03``).

WHICH END OF THE CHORD IS AFT is decided by the rotor frame and not
guessed. A section's extent gives a LINE, which has two ends and no
sign; the sense comes from the tangential direction
``axis x radial``, and aft is the end AGAINST it. So the ``axis`` vector
carries the rotation sense by the right-hand rule, and a rotor turning
the other way is described by passing the axis the other way round. The
sign is resolved once, on the section whose chord is most nearly
tangential (the least twisted one, ordinarily near the tip), and carried
to the other sections by continuity, so a strongly twisted root section
whose chord is nearly axial never has to decide the question on its own.

IT REFUSES RATHER THAN GUESSES. With no axis and hub there is no
spanwise direction and no chord direction, so the extraction refuses
naming both. Guessing a global axis is exactly how a twisted blade gets
the wrong edge silently, which is the failure this capability exists to
remove.

WHAT IT IS EVIDENCE ABOUT. The mid-point criterion was scored against
the solver's own detection stored in a saved simulation of a twisted
blade, and finds exactly the twelve edges the solver marked there; the
import itself was run on a straight wing (RPT-061). The twisted blade has
not been marked by a file on a licensed machine.

    ----------
    mesh : str, pathlib.Path or trimesh.Trimesh
        The blade surface, as a mesh file to read (``.obj`` or ``.stl``)
        or as a loaded mesh. Only its vertices are used. It need not be
        watertight and no proximity query is made, so this runs on a
        base install.
    axis : array_like
        REQUIRED. There is no default and the ``= None`` in the signature
        is a sentinel that exists only so the refusal can name both this
        and ``hub`` together; nothing here guesses an axis, because a
        guessed one silently returns the LEADING edge of a blade whose
        rotor turns the other way.

        Rotor axis of rotation, three components in the mesh's reference
        frame. Normalised internally, so only the direction matters, but
        the SENSE matters: the rotor is taken to turn the right-handed
        way about it, and that is what decides which end of the chord is
        aft. It is a second vocabulary for which way a rotor turns,
        beside the sign a matrix row states in ``RPM_SIGN`` or ``RPM``,
        and nothing reconciles the two; if the extraction returns a
        leading edge, this sign is the first thing to check.
    hub : array_like
        REQUIRED, on the same terms as ``axis`` above. A point on the
        axis of rotation, three components in the mesh's reference frame
        and length units. Together with ``axis`` it fixes the spanwise
        coordinate of every vertex.
    sections : int
        Number of chordwise sections to cut the span into, which is the
        number of nodes returned. At least two: one section yields one
        point, and a single point names no edge.

    Returns
    -------
    TrailingEdge
        The node list and what it was extracted with.

    Raises
    ------
    InputArtifactError
        If ``axis`` or ``hub`` is missing (the refusal names both,
        because neither alone defines a spanwise direction); if either
        is not three finite numbers, or the axis is the zero vector; if
        the mesh file cannot be read, or the loaded object carries no
        usable vertices; if ``sections`` is below
        two; if the vertices have no spanwise extent about the given
        axis; if a section holds too few vertices for its own extent to
        define a chord direction; or if no section's chord has a readable
        component along the tangential direction, which is the shape of
        a mesh, an axis and a hub that do not together describe a rotor
        blade.

        NOT among them, and named because the list would otherwise read
        as exhaustive of what can go wrong: two sections choosing one
        vertex. The sections partition the vertices, so that cannot
        happen; it is an internal invariant rather than a refusal (see

    Parameters
    ----------
    mesh : str, pathlib.Path or trimesh.Trimesh
        The blade surface, as a mesh file to read (``.obj`` or ``.stl``)

    Raises
    ------
    InputArtifactError
        Every refusal of :func:`extract_trailing_edge`; a mesh with no
