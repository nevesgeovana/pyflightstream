    Parameters
    ----------
    verts : numpy.ndarray
        All the mesh's vertices, shape (V, 3).
    families : mapping of str to faces
        Every family of the mesh, in the source's order.
    grids : mapping of str to Grid or Blocks
        The families recovered as grids.
    specs : mapping of str to FamilySpec
        Working specs, updated with each layout's governing factors for its followers.
    te_edges : mapping of str to edges
        The trailing-edge edges of each family.
    where : str
        The source, for a refusal or a warning.
    accept : bool
        Leave a refused layout to the rule of the first grid, with a
        warning, instead of refusing it (``accept_remesh``).
    followers : mapping of str to str, optional
        Working mapping populated with each grid_auto family's governing family.
    assumed : collection of str
        Families whose reference edges were assumed from their longest boundary side.
    prepare : bool
        Select each group's directional leads by total side length, then retain
        only followers whose every arc can propagate with the final declarations.
    components : mapping, optional
        Components whose grids share directional governors; absent keeps layout governing.
    component_governors : dict, optional
        Output mapping populated with the selected component governors.

    Returns
    -------
    dict, list
        The layout of each family resampled in one (every member of a group,
