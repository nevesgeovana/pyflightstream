"""Write a level: the orchestration behind ``pyfs-matrix refine`` and ``refine_mesh``.

FR-424 and FR-425.

The order, from the source to the level folder:

1. read the mesh, the request (:mod:`._config`) and the ``[[perimeter]]``
   node lists that orient the grids and give the trailing edges (:mod:`._lines`);
2. recover the grid of every family asked to change (a sheet, a tube, or a
   multiblock grid of quadrilaterals, :mod:`._blocks`) and decide its
   method, refusing before any work (FR-923 to FR-925);
3. refine the grid families first, in the source's family order; grids that
   share nodes are resampled as one layout, so both hold the same nodes on
   every curve they share, and a grid that cannot join one is remeshed when
   it shares nodes with a grid refined before it (FR-932, :mod:`._blocks`);
4. hand each neighbour the grid's new nodes on their shared curve: a remeshed
   neighbour is rebuilt on them (FR-933), an unchanged one is remeshed at
   factor 1 in a band of two face layers (FR-934), or whole when the band
   would hold every face of it (FR-431); a family remeshed at factor 1 takes,
   along and near that curve, the length of the new shared edges (FR-432);
5. remesh the other families, together where they touch (FR-922);
6. assemble in the source's family order, weld the shared nodes, put each
   band back into its family in the source's order, group the components
   (FR-935), write the level into a temporary folder, audit it there
   (FR-426), and rename it once complete; an existing level is replaced only
   then (FR-918, FR-919).

The boundaries TOML and the ``[[perimeter]]`` node lists are read in step 1,
before any resampling (FR-925).

    Parameters
    ----------
    mesh : path-like
        The source OBJ; it and its folder are never modified.
    factor : float, optional
        The factor of every selected family; without it, and without
        ``parallel`` or ``normal``, the factors come from the refinement file.
    families : sequence of str, optional
        The families to change (default: every family).
    parallel, normal : float, optional
        The factor of every selected grid family along its reference perimeter
        (``parallel``) and across it (``normal``), each replacing ``factor`` there.
    config : path-like, optional
        The refinement file (default: ``<stem>.refine.toml`` beside the mesh).
    out_dir : path-like, optional
        Where the level folder goes (default: the parent of the source's folder).
    overwrite : bool
        Replace an existing level folder.
    keep_first_row : sequence of str, optional
        An earlier option, warned and skipped when given: a row kept at an
        interface is a family of its own.
    progress : callable, optional
        Called with one line per stage and per family as the work goes (read,
        decide, grid, remesh, write, audit), so a long refinement shows it is
        moving; the command prints them. None says nothing.
    accept_remesh : bool
        Remesh with ``factor``, with a warning, a family whose grid is not
        recovered although it states ``parallel_factor`` or ``normal_factor``
        or ``method = "grid"``; by default such a family is refused.
    accept_unknown : bool
        Warn and skip, instead of refusing, an entry the refinement does not
        know or cannot read: an unknown table or key of the refinement file,
        a value it cannot read (the key takes its default), an implicit
        refinement file that cannot be read, a family table or component
        member the mesh does not hold, and a selected family it does not hold.
    force_factors : bool
        Raise a grid factor below the least its grid allows (``1/m`` for its
        ``m`` intervals, the least a tube's caps carry) to that least, with a
        warning (the default); False refuses such a factor (CLI ``--strict-factors``).
    chordwise, spanwise : float, optional
        The earlier names of ``normal`` and ``parallel``, read with a warning;
        beside the new name, the earlier one is warned and skipped.

    Returns
    -------
    RefinedMesh
        The level folder, its files, the per-family report and the audit.

    Raises
    ------
    InputArtifactError
        Every refusal of FR-424 and FR-425, before any file is written.
