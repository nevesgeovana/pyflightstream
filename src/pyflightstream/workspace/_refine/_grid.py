"""The structured grid of a family, recovered and resampled (FR-424 R1, R6, R7, R9, R10).

A GRID FAMILY is recovered from the connectivity alone, never from the vertex
order of the file: quadrilaterals, or quadrilaterals each split into two
triangles, laid out as a SHEET (an open grid with four corners) or as a TUBE
(closed chordwise) whose two ends are each OPEN (a boundary loop), closed by
a POLE fan (triangles around one node) or closed by a ZIPPER cap
(a strip pairing the upper node i with the lower node n - i, a triangle at
each end of the strip). The trailing edge is the grid line through the
family's trailing-edge vertices; it is chordwise index 0. A SMOOTH TUBE (a
body of revolution: a spinner, a nacelle barrel) holds no trailing-edge vertex
and no edge whose dihedral exceeds ``_geometry.RIDGE_DEGREES``; its seam,
chordwise index 0, is the lowest source vertex index of its first station,
and its chordwise direction is resampled by a periodic spline, so the closed
section has no knot and no kink at the seam.

The surface the orchestrator calls:

- :func:`recover_grid` ``(verts, faces, te_vertices)`` returns the
  :class:`Grid` of a family, or the reason, as text, why none was recovered
  (R9 names it in ``refine.json`` and in the refusal of ``method = "grid"``).
- :func:`check_factors` ``(grid, family, chordwise=, spanwise=)`` raises the
  R1 refusal of a factor that is not finite and positive or that is below
  1/m for the m source intervals of its index direction; call it for every
  family before any family is resampled (R11).
- :func:`refine_grid` ``(verts, faces, grid, chordwise=, spanwise=)`` returns
  a :class:`GridLevel`: the new points, the faces as indices into them, the
  trailing-edge mid-points and the per-family report.
- :func:`not_a_knot` is the cubic spline the resampling uses, and
  :func:`periodic` the closed one of a smooth tube's sections, both written
  with numpy alone: this module imports neither scipy nor rtree (R10).

Resampling (R6) is a cubic spline in INDEX space, so the clustering of the
source is kept and only the counts change: ``round(f m)`` intervals per index
direction, counted per stretch between knots (the trailing edge to the
leading edge and back, around a tube). The trailing edge, the leading edge
and the end stations sit at integer parameters, where the spline returns the
source node itself. Each new cell is split along the diagonal of the source
cell its midpoint falls in.

Face order (R7): when the source's lateral faces form one sweep (each cell's
faces consecutive, the cells in row or column order from one start cell),
the level is written in that sweep, each cell's faces following the source
cell's template; otherwise every face takes the position of the nearest
source face (``_geometry.order_like``). The end faces of a tube start on the
vertex playing the role the source's end faces start on. At factor 1 the
level's faces equal the source's in coordinates and in order.
