"""The multiblock grid of an all-quadrilateral family, recovered and resampled.

(FR-915, FR-920, FR-921, FR-923, FR-932).

A family of quadrilaterals that is not one sheet or one tube (a nacelle whose
pylon junction cuts a hole, a fuselage sheet whose boundary has six corners)
is still structured piecewise. Its LAYOUT is found from the connectivity
alone:

1. the SINGULAR vertices are the interior vertices with other than four
   edges or faces, and the boundary vertices with other than two faces (a
   convex corner has one, a re-entrant corner three);
2. from each singular vertex, along each of its interior edges, a SEPARATRIX
   follows the grid line straight through every regular vertex (the edge of
   the four that shares no face with the edge it arrived by) until it reaches
   the boundary or a singular vertex. A grid line through an edge sharper than
   ``_geometry.RIDGE_DEGREES``, or through a trailing-edge edge, is traced the
   same way in both directions, so no spline crosses a ridge;
3. the separatrices and the boundary cut the family into PATCHES, each a
   rectangle of rows by columns of quadrilaterals, and the cut into ARCS,
   each the whole side of one patch or the side two patches share. Lines
   traced to their ends cross one another rather than stopping, so a side
   never meets a corner of the patch beside it: the arcs are the sides.

Resampling (FR-920) keeps that structure: each arc is resampled ONCE, by the
cubic spline of :func:`._grid.not_a_knot` through its source nodes in index
space, to ``round(f m)`` intervals of its m; opposite sides of a patch hold
the same m, so they agree. A patch's interior is the tensor spline of its
nodes, as a single grid's is, and its boundary nodes are the arcs' nodes, so
two patches sharing an arc share its nodes exactly. The source's nodes at
integer parameters are kept bit for bit, the layout's corners among them.
The count of each arc is given per arc (:func:`resample`): ``factor`` applies
to every arc, and ``chordwise`` and ``spanwise`` by the arc's direction, read
from the family's trailing edge (:func:`te_directions`, FR-915, PFS-2150).

Face order (FR-921): every new face takes the position of the source face whose
centroid is nearest (``_geometry.order_like``), each patch oriented like the
source faces it replaces; at factor 1 the family is the source in coordinates
and in order. A family with a face that is not a quadrilateral, or whose
layout is one patch (a sheet or a tube, recovered or refused by
:mod:`._grid`), or whose cut leaves a patch that is not four-sided, has no
multiblock grid, and falls back as before.

GRIDS THAT SHARE NODES ARE RESAMPLED TOGETHER (FR-932). The grid families of
quadrilaterals that touch, sheets and multiblock families alike, are taken
as one surface: the edges where two of them meet are cut, and the grid line
through each is traced on to its end like a separatrix
(:func:`recover_joined`), so the union is cut into four-sided
patches each inside one family, and every curve two families share is the
side of a patch, an ARC, resampled ONCE: both families hold the same nodes on
it. Each new cell is written back to the family of its patch, oriented like
that patch's source faces, and each family's faces are written in its own
source order (FR-921, the nearest source face's position). A lone multiblock
family is the same layout with one family.

THE COUNT OF AN ARC (FR-915) is ``max(1, round(f m))`` of its m source
intervals, f the factor of each family holding it in the arc's direction
(``factor`` in both; a sheet's ``chordwise`` along its stations and
``spanwise`` along its columns, a multiblock family's by its trailing
edge, :func:`te_directions`). Two families giving one arc different counts
are refused naming both and the curve, before any work (FR-925). A side whose
``f m`` is below 1 is kept and reported, as on a lone multiblock family.

A family that cannot join a layout, a tube or a family with a triangle, and
the touching grids whose union is not a layout of four-sided patches, are left
to the rule before this one: the first
of them in the source's family order is a grid, and a later one sharing its
nodes is remeshed, or refused under ``method = "grid"``.

    Each patch is told by its own two pairs of opposite sides: the pair that runs

    other normal, so its rows and columns always differ. An arc a patch shares

    shared arcs disagree within a patch, that patch keeps its own geometric
