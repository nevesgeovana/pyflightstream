"""Prepare an OBJ for the refinement: families split into patches, a refine file and a node list.

``pyfs-workspace geometry prepare-to-refine`` (optional; the refinement reads
any OBJ and refine file without it) writes, beside the mesh:

1. ``<stem>_patches.obj``: every family cut into PATCHES, named
   ``<family>_<NNN>_grid`` or ``<family>_<NNN>_mixed``. A family is first cut
   along its sharp edges (:data:`._geometry.RIDGE_DEGREES`); in each piece, the
   quadrilaterals joined edge to edge whose layout the refinement recovers as a
   grid (a sheet, a tube or a multiblock grid, :mod:`._blocks`) are a grid patch
   each, and the other faces, joined edge to edge, a mixed patch each. The
   original families keep their order; within each, the patches are numbered
   from the largest extent along y down, and each patch keeps its faces in the
   source's order.
2. ``<stem>_patches.refine.toml``: one table per patch, ``method = "grid"`` or
   ``"remesh"`` at factor 1 for the user to edit, the quad-dominant remesh,
   ``[components]`` grouping each family's patches back into the family, and a
   ``[[perimeter]]`` naming the node list with ``te_families``.
3. ``<stem>_patches.nodes.txt``: the node list the refinement reads (an ANSA SET
   node-window export, ``Id, Name, X, Y, Z``): for each grid patch, the nodes of
   the rearmost line of its outer boundary (:func:`._obj.rearmost_edges`) whose
   edges lie in or near the plane across the aft direction (the yz plane for
   +x), within ``max_angle`` (:func:`near_yz`),
   ordered along y. A node two patches share is listed
   once.
