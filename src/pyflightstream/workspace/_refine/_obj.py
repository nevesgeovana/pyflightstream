"""The OBJ and trailing-edge points files a refinement reads and writes (FR-424).

A mesh is one vertex array and an ordered mapping from family name to its
faces, each face a list of 0-based vertex indices. Families are the OBJ
groups (``g``) or objects (``o``) in file order; the comment lines before the
first vertex are kept and written back. Every write goes through the
package's one text route, so a level holds no carriage return (NFR-32).
