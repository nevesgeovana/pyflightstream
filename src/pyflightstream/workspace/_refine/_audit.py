"""The audit of a panel mesh, alone or against its source (FR-426).

THREE KINDS OF RESULT. A GATE (FR-938) is judged on its own terms: the topology,
the orientation, the open boundary, the trailing edge, the shared nodes and
the faces a grid family at factor 1 keeps. A RELATIVE CHECK (FR-939) compares a
95th percentile of the level with the source's, because the source is the
accepted mesh. A FIGURE (FR-940) is reported and never judged. Without a
source only G1, G2 and G4 are judged and the rest is reported (FR-941).

HOW IT MEASURES. Every measure is computed once on all the faces of a mesh
and read per family through the family of each face; an edge belongs to a
family when both its faces do. The audit needs numpy alone and imports
nothing of the refinement modules (FR-924, FR-928), so it judges a level
without them.

WHAT IT WRITES. ``<stem>.audit.json`` beside the mesh audited (a level's
stem is ``<stem>_<tag>``), with ``schema_version``, through the package's one
text route; a gate or check that fails is a warning naming it, the family and
its values. The trailing-edge points file of a mesh is the one its
``<stem>.boundaries.toml`` names under ``[trailing_edges] file``, or else
``<stem>.te.txt`` beside it; its points are converted from the unit on its
first line to the mesh's (the ``[import] units`` of the boundaries file)
before they are matched to the mesh's edges. G4 compares the level's
trailing-edge chains with the source's; a source family whose trailing edge
the refinement detected (FR-956) has no points file to count, so the
record beside the level (``refine.json``, read when it names this level and
the source, as for G6) states it ``"trailing_edge": "detected"`` with the
mid-points of the detected line's edges (``"trailing_edge_points"``, in the
unit of the level's points file), and the source's chains are the connected
components of its listed edges and those edges together, so a detected line
that a listed edge continues is one chain. A family the record states
detected without its points (a record written by hand) counts one chain
when no listed point lies on its edges.
