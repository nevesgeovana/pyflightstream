"""The lines a grid is oriented by: the [[perimeter]] node lists and a family's trailing edge.

A ``[[perimeter]]`` list gives, per family, the mesh edges joining two of its
nodes (:func:`perimeter_lines`); a family on several lines keeps the first that
recovers its grid, the exported lists first (:func:`choose_perimeter_line`). A
grid family with no line takes the longest side of its boundary as reference
(:func:`assume_trailing_edge`), and an incomplete line on a sheet is completed
from the grid (:func:`grid_with_complete_te_edges`). Only the exported lists
are the level's trailing edge (:func:`on_exported`).

The functions read and write the refinement's working state, the ``_Work`` of
:mod:`._level`, passed in as ``work``.
