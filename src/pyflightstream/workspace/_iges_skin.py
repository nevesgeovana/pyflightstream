"""The outer skin of a gridded IGES assembly: the faces that lie inside it are removed.

Untrimmed components cross: a wing runs through the body to the plane of symmetry, a fillet lies
over the wing and the body, a fin root sinks into the body, a tailplane runs through the fin.
After the join every crossing is a curve more than two faces meet along, and the faces split
into regions there (faces of one component joined across edges only two faces use). A selection
of regions is kept when every edge keeps no face or two, every component keeps a region, and
every region it leaves out lies inside what it keeps. Of those selections the one keeping the
largest area is the outer skin.

Inside is measured by the generalized winding number of the kept faces, oriented outward, at the
centres of the region's deepest faces (those farthest from its edge, away from a tangent line
where a fillet starts on the skin it covers): a region is inside when the median is above one
half. The winding number of a surface with an opening, such as a lifting surface without its tip
cap, falls gently near the opening instead of flipping as a ray count would. A half model is
mirrored across its plane of symmetry, the axis plane through the origin that holds the most open
nodes, so a point near that plane sees a closed body.
