"""Rebuild the named hub around each blade root as rings of quads (PFS-2192), on an OBJ.

A hub that is quad-dominant has no complete rings of quads around a blade root, which repitch's
ring route needs. Per blade, ``rings`` rows of quads with as many nodes as the root loop are
marched outward on the hub, the hub faces they reach plus one layer leave, and the annulus
between the outer ring and that hole is remeshed quad-dominant by the remesh ``refine`` uses,
with both loops frozen and every node on the source hub (:mod:`._hub_remesh`, which repitch's
remesh route shares). Blade nodes and root nodes never move; every other family, the hub's open
boundaries (a sector's seams) and the hub faces away from the roots stay to the bit. The kept hub
faces keep their order and the new faces take the place of the first face taken, rings from the
root outward, because the solver's results depend on face order. The quality of the new cells
(folded or turned cells, a node off the hub) is warned with its numbers, and the mesh written.
