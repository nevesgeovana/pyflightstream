"""The mesh reader this package reads surface geometry through.

Pipeline role: below every layer, imported by the ones that need a mesh
and importing nothing from this package. It exists for the same reason
:mod:`pyflightstream._digest` does: two layers need one thing, and
neither may import the other to get it. The probe planner's geometry
gate (a side branch) and the workspace layer's trailing-edge extraction
both read a surface mesh through this shared accessor.

WHY THE IMPORT IS DEFERRED AND NOT AT MODULE LEVEL. ``trimesh`` is a
RUNTIME dependency of this package (design note DD-27), so its absence is a
broken installation rather than
a missing extra. It is still imported at call time, and the reason is
cost rather than availability: ``import pyflightstream`` reaches the
workspace layer eagerly, and a reader that costs 3.89 MiB and pulls its
own numpy machinery has no business being paid for by a user who only
wanted to build a script.

WHAT HAPPENS WHEN IT IS ABSENT. Trimesh is a declared runtime dependency
exactly as numpy and pydantic are, and none of those is guarded anywhere in
this package: an environment missing one is an incomplete install, and the
interpreter's own ``ModuleNotFoundError``, naming the module and nothing
else, is the same answer every other runtime dependency gives. The same
holds for the SPATIAL INDEX (``scipy`` and ``rtree``) that trimesh's
containment and distance-to-surface queries go through: both are runtime
dependencies too.
