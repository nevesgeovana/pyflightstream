# Upgrading

Read the migration records for the releases between your installed version and the version you are adopting. Each record states the changes a workspace needs.

## 0.40.0

The tier-3 maintenance programs have several corrected behaviors:

- `tests/tier3_licensed/actions_probe.py` and `duct.py` can now start as
  scripts from another working directory, with no `PYTHONPATH` setting.
  Use the full script path when starting them outside the repository.
- `tests/tier3_licensed/mesh_routes.py` applies the same relative `1e-9`
  rounding slack to its unit-conversion verdict and its route comparisons.
  A gap of exactly one printed unit can now report `IMPORT CONVERTS` when
  binary rounding previously put it just above the band.
- `tests/tier3_licensed/rotation_null.py` resolves the simulation ID from
  the leading token of each point name, for both angle signs. It now scores
  the recorded products instead of raising `KeyError` before comparison.
