# pyflightstream

Version-aware, didactic Python driver for the FlightStream panel-method
solver. MIT licensed.

Status: v0.7.0 is the current release; the changelog records what each
release adds. This release registers an eighth FlightStream build the day
after the vendor issued it, and every command any of the eight manual editions
registered AT THAT POINT documents has an entry, at the level the release notes
measure it. A ninth build, 26.123, has since been registered and deliberately
inherits nothing, so nothing carried over to it and every row it holds was read
on its own edition; the eight-edition claim above is about the editions
registered at that point and says nothing about this one. The release before it registered three older builds and
gave every registered build the vendor build number its solver prints,
so an install can be identified rather than described. Five command-line
tools ship with the package: `pyfs-qa`
(probes, physics regression, drift), `pyfs-workspace` (campaign
workspace init), `pyfs-matrix` (run-matrix convert, pre-flight and run),
`pyfs-fsi` (the aeroelastic coupling executable), and `pyfs-manual`
(maintainer tool: compares a vendor manual against the command
database, reports what each build documents and what changed between
builds, and re-reads the page citations already written to check they
still point where they say; needs the `[manual]` extra). Two of
`pyfs-manual`'s six subcommands WRITE, and `register` is the only thing
in this package that edits the shipped command database from a reading:
it carries a build's documentation forward for the commands its edition
describes exactly as the edition before it did, and reports the rest for
a person. Both write only with an explicit `--write`.

## The idea in one paragraph

FlightStream is scripted through ASCII command files, and the solver is
under active development, with intermediate hotfix builds consolidating
user requests into stable releases; the command set evolves with it. This
package makes the FlightStream version an explicit input. A per-version command
database, with a manual page or probe-report citation on every entry and
empirical probe evidence for every verified status, backs a script builder
that refuses to
emit anything invalid for the requested version. Old versions are only ever
added, never dropped.

## The documentation

* [Software Requirements Specification](srs/index.md): the living SRS,
  from the founding requirements to the usage-feedback line, each with
  origin, status, and evidence.
* [Architecture overview](architecture.md): the layered pipeline and one
  section per subpackage, generated at every docs build from the live
  module docstrings. `pyflightstream.overview()` renders the same page
  offline.
* [Getting started](getting-started.md): install, pick a version, build a
  script, declare and pre-flight a campaign, read the results. Half an hour,
  and no solver until the last step.
* [The workspace and the workflow](workspace-and-workflows.md): what a
  workspace is and what it is for, in plain language, then the path from a
  filled-in run matrix to results. Every artefact on it is lifted from an
  executed test, and it states what is NOT built as plainly as what is.
* [The numeric settings codebook](settings-codebook.md): the frozen
  encoding of the optional all-numeric settings table, for tools that
  cannot read strings. The page is the contract and a test holds the
  library to it.
* [Replaying a recorded run](tutorial-replay.md): what the manifest keeps,
  how to rebuild the exact invocation from it, how to tell whether the
  evidence still matches, and what a record cannot give you.
* [Command reference](reference/index.md): generated from the database at
  every docs build, one page per manual chapter, with per-version evidence
  for every command. `pyflightstream.help()` renders the same database
  offline.
* [Which build do I have](builds.md): the release name and build number
  your solver prints, mapped onto the identifier to pass. The release
  name alone does not identify a build, and for the 26.12 builds it
  is not even the name the vendor sells them under.
* [Compatibility matrix](compatibility.md): every command against every
  registered FlightStream version, generated from the same database. Cells
  are filled only by evidence: for `documented`, the manual page or a
  committed probe report where no edition documents the command; for
  `verified`, `broken` and a measured `removed`, a committed probe
  report. Empty cells are
  honest gaps awaiting backfill.
* [House conventions](conventions.md): the naming and nomenclature rules
  the library holds itself to, generated from `reference.CONVENTIONS`,
  the same source as the offline `help()` section.
* [Mesh inputs and GUI-only operations](mesh-inputs.md): the supported
  workflow when a step exists in the GUI but has no scripting command,
  the canonical mesh input routes, and the mesh format policy.
* [Sister library (ITACA)](sister-itaca.md): the co-development model,
  the division of labor, and the cross-requirement convention shared
  with the ITACA analysis library.

## Evidence discipline

The three QA tiers behind the statuses:

* Tier 1 runs in CI without the solver: schema integrity, builder
  goldens, parser fixtures.
* Tier 2 probes command validity on a licensed machine; reports live
  under `reports/compat/` and statuses are promoted only from them.
* Tier 3 runs a physics regression matrix and a cross-version drift
  suite; reports live under `reports/physics/`.

The [campaign from a run matrix](examples/campaign_matrix.md) example
already walks the run-matrix to `campaign.toml` to pre-flight path
end to end; the LaTeX user guide (`guide/`) covers the full workflow.

## Planned next

The campaign walkthrough this section used to promise SHIPPED on
2026-08-19 as [the workspace and the workflow](workspace-and-workflows.md),
so the bullet is retired rather than left standing beside the page that
delivers it. What that page does not cover, it says so itself, in its own
closing section.
