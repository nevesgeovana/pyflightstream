# Functional requirements

Numbering is stable: a deprecated requirement keeps its identifier
forever. Each requirement cites its origin (BRF and PP items, see the
[introduction](introduction.md)) and carries a status with evidence.
Milestones and session records are listed in the
[roadmap](roadmap.md).

## Version-aware command database

!!! requirement "FR-01 Command database <span class='srs-implemented'>implemented</span>"
    *Origin: BRF-03, PP-8. Evidence: milestone M1; the database and
    its Tier 1 schema tests.*

    The package ships a machine-readable database of FlightStream
    script commands. Each entry records name, layout grammar, typed
    arguments, the version span in which it exists, per-version
    argument differences, and a manual page citation.

!!! requirement "FR-02 Launch version set and ordering <span class='srs-implemented'>implemented</span>"
    *Origin: BRF-07, BRF-19. Evidence: milestone M1; `versions` tests.*

    The database covers versions 26.0, 26.1, and 26.12 at launch,
    with an explicit ordered version list. Version ordering never
    relies on string or float comparison ("26.1" < "26.12" fails
    both).

!!! requirement "FR-02a Canonical 26.XXX identifiers <span class='srs-implemented'>implemented</span>"
    *Origin: BRF-19. Evidence: milestone M1.*

    The canonical version identifier is `26.XXX` with exactly three
    fractional digits: the first two carry the official minor release,
    the last indexes intermediate hotfix builds (0 = the official
    release). Launch set: 26.000, 26.100, 26.120. The registry stores
    display aliases so users may write "26.12" and get 26.120.

!!! requirement "FR-03 Evidence-backed per-version statuses <span class='srs-implemented'>implemented</span>"
    *Origin: BRF-03. Evidence: milestone M1 (schema), M3 (first
    promotions); committed compat reports.*

    Each command carries a per-version status: `documented`,
    `verified`, `broken`, or `removed`. Documented and verified are
    distinct because the manual and the solver disagree in practice.
    Statuses are promoted only by committed probe reports.

!!! requirement "FR-04 Build-time version refusal <span class='srs-implemented'>implemented</span>"
    *Origin: BRF-03, PP-8. Evidence: milestone M1; refusal tests and
    the worked example's didactic 26.0 refusal.*

    Building a script with a command that does not exist in the
    target version fails at build time, before any solver run, with
    an error that cites the manual and suggests the successor command
    when one is known.

## Script construction

!!! requirement "FR-05 No global state <span class='srs-implemented'>implemented</span>"
    *Origin: PP-2. Evidence: milestone M2; concurrent-build tests.*

    Script construction uses an object bound to a version-specific
    registry view, so two scripts build concurrently without
    interference. This is the script-construction consequence of
    [AD-03](architecture-srs.md), which is the single home of the
    no-global-mutable-state rule.

!!! requirement "FR-06 Curated helpers <span class='srs-implemented'>implemented</span>"
    *Origin: BRF-04. Evidence: milestone M2; helper goldens
    ([glossary](index.md#glossary)).*

    A curated set of thin helpers covers the common steady and
    unsteady workflows, and each helper emits only database-validated
    commands, adding no emitted line the command database does not
    define.

    Reworded 2026-07-27: "adds no hidden logic" stated an intention no
    test could fail. What replaces it is the same promise as a property
    of the emitted script, which a golden can check.

!!! requirement "FR-07 Recorded escape hatch <span class='srs-implemented'>implemented</span>"
    *Origin: BRF-12. Evidence: milestone M2; the manifest raw flag.*

    A raw-emission escape hatch allows arbitrary lines, and its use
    is recorded in the run manifest, so no run silently depends on
    unvalidated commands.

!!! requirement "FR-08 Clean-room emitter <span class='srs-implemented'>implemented</span>"
    *Origin: BRF-10. Evidence: repository invariant; contribution
    policy.*

    The emitter layer is specified exclusively from the official
    manual and from probe evidence, and its clean-room provenance is
    verified by the contribution attestation recorded per change rather
    than by a runtime test. No code, structure, or docstrings derive
    from the AGPL ecosystem predecessor.

    Reworded 2026-07-27 to name its verification honestly. No test can
    observe how a line of code came to be written, so a requirement that
    implied one was promising evidence that does not exist; the
    attestation is the evidence that does.

!!! requirement "FR-08a Phase ordering enforced <span class='srs-implemented'>implemented</span>"
    *Origin: BRF-13. Evidence: milestone M1 (phases in the schema),
    M2 (builder enforcement); phase tests.*

    Database entries carry a script phase. The builder validates
    ordering at build time: pre-solver definitions emitted after
    solver initialization are rejected with a didactic error, and
    referencing an undefined entity fails at build time, not run time.

## Case and campaign model

!!! requirement "FR-09 Typed, simulation-centric model <span class='srs-implemented'>implemented</span>"
    *Origin: BRF-01, BRF-16. Evidence: milestone M2.*

    Cases and campaigns are typed data objects. The unit of work is a
    SIM with a `sim_id`. A campaign declares its FlightStream version
    and executable path per [AD-04](architecture-srs.md), which is the
    single home of the explicit-never-guessed rule.

!!! requirement "FR-10 Run-matrix reader, forever <span class='srs-implemented'>implemented</span>"
    *Origin: BRF-08. Evidence: milestone M2; the verified 15-column
    layout and its fixtures.*

    A dedicated reader consumes the documented pipe-delimited
    run-matrix format: rows with RUN = 1 are active, the sweep columns
    define alpha, beta, or advance-ratio sweeps, and the variables
    column holds KEY:VALUE pairs. A column the reader does not
    recognize is preserved and reported rather than silently dropped.

    Reworded 2026-07-27. "Forever" is scoped to the EXTERNAL format,
    which is the promise that matters to the author's existing files,
    rather than reading as a promise never to change the reader. The
    unknown-column clause is new and closes a silent-loss path the
    original left unstated.

!!! requirement "FR-11 Lossless one-command conversion <span class='srs-implemented'>implemented</span>"
    *Origin: BRF-08, BRF-16. Evidence: milestone M2; TOML round-trip
    tests ([glossary](index.md#glossary)); the `pyfs-matrix convert`
    CLI (v0.3 line).*

    A convert command turns a run matrix into the native campaign
    format in one optional invocation, and a reverse conversion
    reproduces every field of the original matrix, verified by a
    round-trip ([glossary](index.md#glossary)) test. The matrix POL
    column maps to the native `sim_id`; the matrix reference codes are
    preserved verbatim.

    Reworded 2026-07-27: "lossless" named a property without saying how
    anyone would know. The reverse conversion is what makes it
    checkable, and it is the same claim stated as a test.

!!! requirement "FR-12 Recipes as explicit protocol <span class='srs-implemented'>implemented</span>"
    *Origin: PP-7. Evidence: milestone M2; recipe registry tests.*

    Script recipes are explicitly imported functions conforming to a
    documented protocol, replacing the predecessor's runtime file
    lookup by numeric code.

## Execution

!!! requirement "FR-13 Safe headless execution <span class='srs-implemented'>implemented</span>"
    *Origin: PP-5. Evidence: milestone M2; the executor tests and the
    documented headless invocation (SRC-003 pp.279-280).*

    Execution goes through an executor interface. The local executor
    uses subprocess with a timeout, checks return codes, and never
    uses `shell=True` ([glossary](index.md#glossary)).

!!! requirement "FR-14 Every point terminates in a status <span class='srs-implemented'>implemented</span>"
    *Origin: PP-5, BRF-12. Evidence: milestone M2; campaign-loop
    tests.*

    A campaign run records every datapoint outcome. Failures are
    collected and reported at the end as a structured error; a silent
    skip is structurally impossible.

!!! requirement "FR-15 HPC executor <span class='srs-pending'>pending</span>"
    *Origin: BRF-01.*

    An HPC executor submits runs through a cluster submission path.
    The executor interface must allow this without changes to the
    campaign model. Deferred; no cluster path ships today.

## Results and provenance

!!! requirement "FR-16 Anchor-based parsing <span class='srs-implemented'>implemented</span>"
    *Origin: PP-4. Evidence: milestone M2; parser fixtures from real
    solver output.*

    Output parsers locate data by anchors (labeled values, delimited
    tables), never by absolute line offsets.

!!! requirement "FR-17 Structural completeness checks <span class='srs-implemented'>implemented</span>"
    *Origin: PP-5. Evidence: milestone M2; incomplete-output tests.*

    An output file without its expected footer is
    FAILED_INCOMPLETE_OUTPUT, not a shorter table.

!!! requirement "FR-18 Version cross-check <span class='srs-implemented'>implemented</span>"
    *Origin: BRF-03. Evidence: milestone M2; the lax cross-check
    recording string and build verbatim.*

    The FlightStream version reported in outputs is cross-checked
    against the requested version; a mismatch raises a warning
    recorded in the manifest.

!!! requirement "FR-19 The manifest <span class='srs-implemented'>implemented</span>"
    *Origin: PP-6. Evidence: milestone M2; manifest tests; extended
    by FR-31.*

    Every campaign writes `runs.json` recording per run: identity,
    case point, versions and build, package version, input and script
    hashes, status, iterations, residual, wall time, outputs, and
    error text. Folder names are never authoritative.

## Post-processing

!!! requirement "FR-20 Labeled result arrays <span class='srs-pending'>pending</span>"
    *Origin: BRF-01, BRF-18.*

    The result-array API provides labeled multidimensional arrays,
    interpolation along named axes, axis re-parameterization, and trim
    extraction by interpolating a moment coefficient to zero.

    De-narrated 2026-07-27: the requirement states the capability, and
    how much of it exists today belongs to the status tag and the
    roadmap, which is where a reader looks for progress. What was
    narrated here and is not lost: sweep assembly landed as FR-32, field
    data as the far-field ledgers of FR-38, and interpolation and trim
    are the open half, which AD-06 sends to the sister library.

!!! requirement "FR-21 Established plot-file writers <span class='srs-pending'>pending</span>"
    *Origin: BRF-01.*

    Plot files byte-compatible with the author's established plot
    format, with a reader making the pair round-trip testable. Not
    yet started; VTK and Tecplot probe-data writers exist in `post/`
    but that plot format is not among them.

    Probe field data is a separate matter and already ships: the VTK
    legacy and Tecplot point writers of `post/writers.py` export it
    with a documented field-to-column mapping
    (`tests/test_post_writers.py`). Recorded here rather than under an
    identifier of its own because that is where the author folded it
    when she accepted it, against the option of making it a public
    functional requirement.

!!! requirement "FR-22 Per-boundary drag honesty <span class='srs-implemented'>implemented</span>"
    *Origin: PP-5. Evidence: the v0.3 line, corrected by PLN-075 after
    a re-reading of the manual page; the vorticity selection of
    `solver_settings` with its two drag methods documented and
    snapshotted (SRC-003 p.202).*

    Per-boundary drag bookkeeping respects the documented vorticity
    CDi pitfall: a boundary without a user-defined trailing-edge
    condition reports zero induced drag once it is assigned to the
    vorticity CDi list. The API does not aggregate blindly, the
    vorticity selection is an explicit input of the solver settings,
    and leaving it unset is the documented solver default (surface
    pressure integration on every boundary), recorded as such in the
    solver-setup snapshot rather than refused. On a FlightStream
    version where the selection command has no recorded evidence, the
    snapshot states unknown instead of claiming the default.

## FSI

!!! requirement "FR-23 FSI seam at v0.1 <span class='srs-deprecated'>deprecated</span>"
    *Origin: BRF-11. Superseded by FR-23a; kept as the accurate v0.1
    record.*

    At v0.1 the package exposed only the coupling seam: the FSI
    command family in the database and a structural-solver protocol
    stub. No structural solver shipped.

!!! requirement "FR-23a In-package FSI subpackage <span class='srs-implemented'>implemented</span>"
    *Origin: amendment of 2026-07-21. Evidence: milestone M6; the
    coupled near-rigid pilot report and the frozen replay.*

    From M6 the structural coupling tool is the `fsi` subpackage:
    config schema, loads parser, beam builder, centrifugal terms,
    kinematics, node generation, coupling driver, and the `pyfs-fsi`
    entry point. The structural dependency enters only as the
    optional `[fsi]` extra, never vendored, with committed license
    evidence.

## Quality assurance

!!! requirement "FR-24 CI-runnable test suite <span class='srs-implemented'>implemented</span>"
    *Origin: PP-9. Evidence: the Tier 1 suite in CI on every push.*

    A CI-runnable suite covers database integrity, emission
    validation including removed and renamed command scenarios,
    parser fixtures, golden scripts, and matrix reader equivalence.
    FlightStream itself is never required in CI.

!!! requirement "FR-25 Probe harness <span class='srs-implemented'>implemented</span>"
    *Origin: BRF-03. Evidence: milestone M3; the committed compat
    reports and the promotion mechanism.*

    A probe harness runs per-command probe scripts on a licensed
    machine, asserts real effects, and promotes results into database
    statuses through committed compatibility reports.

!!! requirement "FR-26 Physics regression matrix <span class='srs-implemented'>implemented</span>"
    *Origin: BRF-12, BRF-17. Evidence: milestones M4 onward; the
    banded-reference reports. Expansion (mesh refinement, solver-flag
    cases) queued for licensed sessions.*

    A physics regression matrix on synthetic geometry guards physical
    sanity per release. Each guarded coefficient is compared against a
    committed reference with a per-coefficient error metric, absolute
    for coefficients that pass through zero and relative otherwise, and
    with WARN and FAIL band values derived from measured run-to-run
    repeatability rather than chosen. A reference update states its
    reason.

    Reworded 2026-07-27 to say which metric, which basis, and that the
    bands are measured. The band VALUES stay in the committed reference
    files rather than being copied here, because they are per case and
    per coefficient and this requirement would go stale the first time
    one moved.

!!! requirement "FR-27 Two geometry classes for drift <span class='srs-implemented'>implemented</span>"
    *Origin: BRF-17. Evidence: milestone M4; the drift suite and its
    committed reports.*

    Version-comparison cases come in two classes: synthetic
    geometries, committable and generated by the suite; and local
    research cases whose geometry never enters the repository, with
    only aggregated coefficients in the committed reports.

## File management

!!! requirement "FR-28 The package owns the layout <span class='srs-implemented'>implemented</span>"
    *Origin: BRF-15, BRF-14. Evidence: milestone M2; extended by
    FR-33.*

    The package creates and names per-campaign and per-simulation
    folder trees itself, standardized English names derived from
    `sim_id` and the manifest. No user hand-builds a run folder.

!!! requirement "FR-29 Staging, hashing, archiving <span class='srs-implemented'>implemented</span>"
    *Origin: BRF-15, PP-6, PP-7. Evidence: milestone M2; archive
    refusal tests.*

    The package stages inputs into the run folder, records their
    hashes in the manifest, collects outputs to declared locations,
    and provides archive and cleanup operations that refuse to touch
    folders whose manifest is missing or inconsistent.

## Usage-feedback requirements (2026-07-22)

Requirements added from the author's first outside-the-repo use of
the public 0.2.0, through the five-stage triage process recorded in
the session records.

!!! requirement "FR-30 Entity labels <span class='srs-implemented'>implemented</span>"
    *Origin: usage feedback. Evidence: the v0.3 line; registry tests.
    The fsm-to-obj boundary inspector is
    <span class='srs-deferred'>deferred</span> behind a licensed
    probe (does the OBJ export write one named group per boundary?).*

    FlightStream is index-parameterized; pyflightstream identifies
    entities by label. The builder registry tracks frames, actuators,
    motions, and boundaries with optional labels; every entity-citing
    argument accepts index or label; declared boundary inventories
    are range-checked; undeclared stays permissive because the total
    lives in the geometry file.

!!! requirement "FR-31 Solver-setup provenance <span class='srs-implemented'>implemented</span>"
    *Origin: usage feedback. Evidence: the v0.3 line; snapshot
    round-trip tests. Evidence for the remaining unknown defaults is
    <span class='srs-deferred'>deferred</span> to the licensed queue.*

    The solver settings helper is the single entry point for every
    solver flag and returns a snapshot recording each flag's
    effective value with provenance: explicit, evidence-cited
    default, or unknown (never guessed). The snapshot rides the
    manifest, and a script can be regenerated from it. The set of
    physics-material flags carried as unknown is confirmed complete per
    supported version, and the confirmation is recorded in that
    version's compatibility report.

    The completeness clause was accepted 2026-07-27 and is the half
    that needs licensed evidence: an unknown flag nobody has enumerated
    is indistinguishable from one that does not exist. Split into FR-31a
    and FR-31b for the two claims a test can falsify separately.

!!! requirement "FR-32 Tabular results <span class='srs-implemented'>implemented</span>"
    *Origin: usage feedback. Evidence: the v0.3 line; table tests on
    the sanitized fixtures.*

    Every parser result converts to a tidy table
    ([glossary](index.md#glossary)) and to csv; a run merges into one
    wide row (identity, conditions, coefficients, with identity
    cross-checks); a whole sweep assembles from the manifest alone.

    The tidy table is a pandas DataFrame today and stops being one at
    v0.5.0 ([AD-06](architecture-srs.md) is the decision;
    [NFR-06](nonfunctional-requirements.md) is the home of the release
    number). The shape is the
    requirement, not the library holding it, and the column schema that
    survives the change is [NFR-19](nonfunctional-requirements.md).

!!! requirement "FR-33 Input-artifact library and naming templates <span class='srs-implemented'>implemented</span>"
    *Origin: BRF-20. Evidence: the v0.3 line; artifact and
    no-parse-back tests.*

    The workspace organizes inputs: declarative TOML artifacts
    (references, setups, groups, geometries, profiles, executables by
    build id) resolved by stable id with didactic misses. Output
    naming is templatable and output-only: the manifest stays the
    sole identity authority and no parse-back API exists. A case whose
    sweep points would render the same output name is blocked before
    it runs, because every point of a case executes in one simulation
    folder and a shared name destroys the evidence of all but the last
    (incident INC-20260723-2113).

!!! requirement "FR-34 Pre-flight and resume <span class='srs-implemented'>implemented</span>"
    *Origin: usage feedback. Evidence: the v0.3 line; pre-flight and
    resume tests.*

    A campaign can be pre-flighted with zero solver time (recipes
    resolved, scripts dry-run built, folders allocated, geometry
    verified, plan written) and re-run with resume semantics that
    skip manifest-recorded points, enabling incremental sweeps.

!!! requirement "FR-35 Matrix as first-class interface <span class='srs-implemented'>implemented</span>"
    *Origin: usage feedback, amending the posture of FR-10/FR-11.
    Evidence: the v0.3 line; resolution hit and miss tests.*

    The run matrix is a first-class interface of the file-managed
    modality: its reference columns resolve against the workspace
    input library, and one call takes a matrix through conversion,
    pre-flight, and execution. The native campaign format remains
    the canonical internal form.

!!! requirement "FR-36 Two-level help <span class='srs-implemented'>implemented</span>"
    *Origin: usage feedback. Evidence: the v0.3 line; overview and
    coverage tests.*

    Help has two zoom levels: the command reference (with a
    manual-coverage section stating what the database does and does
    not yet cover) and the architecture overview generated from the
    live module docstrings. Both render offline and in the docs from
    single sources.

## Phase 5 consolidation (2026-07-27)

The requirements below complete the author's Phase 4 acceptance batch.
Three groups: the singular claims split out of an existing requirement,
which keep their base's identifier plus a letter; the identifiers the
batch created; and the identifiers this session allocated for
acceptances that arrived without one. The
[mapping register](../requirement-mapping.md) records which accepted
item became which identifier, so the check that produced this section is
re-runnable.

### Splits

A split does not change what the base requires. It gives each claim
inside it an identifier that a single test can falsify, which is what
the base could not offer while it bundled several.

!!! requirement "FR-02b Version ordering authority <span class='srs-implemented'>implemented</span>"
    *Origin: Phase 4 split of FR-02, accepted 2026-07-27. Evidence:
    milestone M1; `tests/test_versions.py`.*

    Version ordering never relies on string or float comparison, and
    the ordered list in `commands/_meta.yaml` is the sole ordering
    authority, so that 26.100 sorts before 26.120.

!!! requirement "FR-22a Not-computed induced-drag sentinel <span class='srs-deferred'>deferred</span>"
    *Origin: Phase 4 split of FR-22, accepted 2026-07-27.*

    A boundary without a user-defined trailing-edge condition, once
    assigned to the vorticity induced-drag list, returns a not-computed
    sentinel distinguishable from a physical zero.

    Deferred, not implemented, and the correction is worth stating
    because the first draft of this box claimed otherwise. Parsed
    coefficients are plain floats today, so a solver-reported zero and
    a not-computed value are the same bytes; the distinction this
    requirement asks for does not exist in the code. Its own acceptance
    also gated the sentinel VALUE on the FR-22 probe promotion, which
    the same batch deferred for lack of licensed evidence, so promoting
    it here would have run ahead of the evidence it depends on.

!!! requirement "FR-22b Vorticity selection is an explicit input <span class='srs-implemented'>implemented</span>"
    *Origin: Phase 4 split of FR-22, accepted 2026-07-27. Evidence: the
    v0.3 line; solver-setup snapshot tests.*

    The vorticity induced-drag selection is an explicit solver-settings
    input, and leaving it unset is recorded in the solver-setup snapshot
    as the documented default, which is surface-pressure integration on
    every boundary.

!!! requirement "FR-22c Unknown rather than assumed default <span class='srs-implemented'>implemented</span>"
    *Origin: Phase 4 split of FR-22, accepted 2026-07-27. Evidence: the
    v0.3 line; solver-setup snapshot tests.*

    On a FlightStream version with no recorded evidence for the
    selection command, the snapshot states unknown rather than the
    default.

!!! requirement "FR-30a Entities carry labels, not positions <span class='srs-implemented'>implemented</span>"
    *Origin: Phase 4 split of FR-30, accepted 2026-07-27. Evidence: the
    v0.3 line; `tests/test_script_entities.py`.*

    The builder registry identifies frames, actuators, motions, and
    boundaries by optional label rather than by the solver's positional
    index.

!!! requirement "FR-30b Index or label, everywhere <span class='srs-implemented'>implemented</span>"
    *Origin: Phase 4 split of FR-30, accepted 2026-07-27. Evidence: the
    v0.3 line; `tests/test_script_entities.py`.*

    Every entity-citing argument accepts either an index or a label.

!!! requirement "FR-30c Declared inventories are range-checked <span class='srs-implemented'>implemented</span>"
    *Origin: Phase 4 split of FR-30, accepted 2026-07-27. Evidence: the
    v0.3 line; `tests/test_script_entities.py`.*

    A declared boundary inventory is range-checked, and an undeclared
    inventory stays permissive, because the total lives in the geometry
    file rather than in the script.

!!! requirement "FR-31a Solver settings are one entry point with provenance <span class='srs-implemented'>implemented</span>"
    *Origin: Phase 4 split of FR-31, accepted 2026-07-27. Evidence: the
    v0.3 line; `tests/test_solver_setup.py`.*

    The solver-settings helper is the single entry point for every
    solver flag and returns a snapshot recording each flag's effective
    value with its provenance: explicit, evidence-cited default, or
    unknown, never guessed.

!!! requirement "FR-31b The snapshot rides the manifest <span class='srs-implemented'>implemented</span>"
    *Origin: Phase 4 split of FR-31, accepted 2026-07-27. Evidence: the
    v0.3 line; `tests/test_solver_setup.py`.*

    The snapshot rides the manifest, and a runnable script is
    regenerated from it.

!!! requirement "FR-31c The unknown set is confirmed complete <span class='srs-deferred'>deferred</span>"
    *Origin: the FR-31 flag-completeness acceptance, 2026-07-27,
    allocated its own identifier here.*

    The set of physics-material flags carried as unknown in the
    solver-setup snapshot is confirmed complete per supported version,
    and the confirmation is recorded in that version's compatibility
    report.

    It has its own identifier because it is the half that needs
    licensed evidence, and leaving it inside a box badged implemented
    is exactly what splitting a requirement is for: an unknown flag
    nobody has enumerated is indistinguishable from one that does not
    exist.

!!! requirement "FR-33a Input-artifact library <span class='srs-implemented'>implemented</span>"
    *Origin: Phase 4 split of FR-33, accepted 2026-07-27. Evidence: the
    v0.3 line; `tests/test_workspace.py`.*

    The workspace organizes declarative TOML input artifacts
    (references, setups, groups, geometries, profiles, and executables
    by build id) resolved by stable id, with a didactic message when an
    id misses.

!!! requirement "FR-33b Naming is output-only <span class='srs-implemented'>implemented</span>"
    *Origin: Phase 4 split of FR-33, accepted 2026-07-27. Evidence: the
    v0.3 line; the no-parse-back guard in `tests/test_workspace.py`.*

    Output naming is templatable and output-only; the manifest is the
    sole identity authority and no parse-back API exists.

!!! requirement "FR-33c Colliding output names are blocked before the run <span class='srs-implemented'>implemented</span>"
    *Origin: Phase 4 split of FR-33, accepted 2026-07-27, giving the
    incident guard its own identifier. Evidence: incident
    INC-20260723-2113; `tests/test_run_campaign.py`.*

    A case whose sweep points would render the same output name is
    blocked before it runs, because every point of the case executes in
    one simulation folder.

### New identifiers from the batch

!!! requirement "FR-37 Convergence status <span class='srs-pending'>pending</span>"
    *Origin: Phase 4 review, accepted 2026-07-27.*

    A datapoint whose recorded residual does not reach the configured
    convergence threshold terminates with a status distinct from a
    completed one, even when the output footer is structurally
    complete.

    Stated without naming the value, and pending rather than
    implemented, because of a collision the same batch created and this
    consolidation is the first place to record. FR-46 closes the
    terminal-status set at the six values `RunStatus` carries today, and
    a run that reaches the iteration cap without converging currently
    lands in `COMPLETED_MAX_ITER`, which is a completed status. Adding
    the value this requirement asks for makes seven. Both are the
    author's acceptances, so which of the two moves is her call: either
    FR-46's set opens to seven, or `COMPLETED_MAX_ITER` is judged to
    already satisfy this requirement and FR-37 closes as covered.

!!! requirement "FR-38 Far-field conservation ledgers <span class='srs-deferred'>deferred</span>"
    *Origin: Phase 4 review, accepted 2026-07-27, absorbing the C11
    acceptance of the same subject. Evidence for the delivered half:
    milestone M7; the G0 synthetic gate in `tests/test_farfield.py`.*

    The far-field subpackage computes the mass, momentum, swirl,
    crossflow-kinetic-energy, and rothalpy conservation ledgers on the
    survey lattice, evaluates gates G1, G3, and G4 and the near-field
    versus far-field spurious diagnostic, and records each ledger and
    gate outcome in the run outputs.

    Deferred rather than implemented because the ledgers and the G0
    synthetic gate ship while G1, G3, and G4 need licensed solver
    evidence that does not exist yet. Scope note: AD-06 moves the
    generic half of this machinery to the sister library, so what stays
    here is the FlightStream-side application and the lattice adapter.

!!! requirement "FR-39 Public exception hierarchy <span class='srs-pending'>pending</span>"
    *Origin: Phase 4 review, accepted 2026-07-27, absorbing the C2
    catalog acceptance and the M1 typed-hierarchy mirror. Evidence:
    `src/pyflightstream/exceptions.py`;
    `tests/test_exceptions_catalog.py`.*

    Every exception raised by the public API derives from a single
    documented base exception, each type is documented with the
    condition that raises it, and every exception and warning is
    re-exported from one catalog module, so that a class defined
    outside the catalog fails the suite.

    Pending on its first clause, which is the load-bearing one for a
    user: there is no single base class today. The catalog exists, it
    is complete, and a class outside it fails the suite
    (`tests/test_exceptions_catalog.py`), but the types derive from
    stdlib bases, so a caller cannot catch everything this package
    raises with one except clause. That is the half a user asked for
    and the half not yet built.

    The family names are this package's own (version, physics, IO,
    evidence). Only the pattern is borrowed from the sister library,
    which is what the M1 acceptance said in its own text.

!!! requirement "FR-40 Options and parameter registry <span class='srs-pending'>pending</span>"
    *Origin: Phase 4 review, accepted 2026-07-27, absorbing the C1
    acceptance of the same subject.*

    Every user-facing option or parameter is declared in a single
    registry recording its type, default, and validation rule, and the
    CLIs and the Python API resolve options through that registry;
    setting an unknown option, or a value outside its declared domain,
    raises an error naming the option and its allowed values. Every
    registered option name is a stable public contract, which is the
    form she chose against the review's recommended narrowing.

    Pending on its quantifier. The registry exists and its refusal
    behaviour is tested (`src/pyflightstream/options.py`,
    `tests/test_options.py`), but it holds three keys, all under `qa`,
    with one CLI consuming it and no Python-API parameter resolving
    through it. "Every" is the promise; a first consumer is what
    shipped.

!!! requirement "FR-41 ITACA adapter <span class='srs-pending'>pending</span>"
    *Origin: Phase 4 review, accepted 2026-07-27.*

    The package emits ITACA datasets from the manifest and the results
    schema, with a documented field mapping.

    Restated on the day it was written, because the draft accepted in
    this batch placed the adapter "behind the optional `[itaca]` extra"
    and a decision of the same batch removed that boundary: AD-07 makes
    the sister library a core dependency, so there is no extra to sit
    behind and no missing-extra hint to give. The capability is
    unchanged; only its packaging boundary is, and the requirement
    states the capability.

!!! requirement "FR-42 Reference-frame and sign conventions <span class='srs-implemented'>implemented</span>"
    *Origin: Phase 4 review, accepted 2026-07-27. Evidence:
    `reference.CONVENTIONS`, rendered offline and on the docs site from
    one source; `tests/test_conventions.py`. The implemented status
    covers the STATING half: the conventions are published from one
    home and guarded there. That every emitted coefficient conforms to
    them is asserted by no test, and saying so here is the alternative
    to a badge that implies one.*

    The package states the reference-frame and sign conventions for
    reported forces, moments, and rotor quantities, naming the positive
    axis directions, the moment reference point, and the rotor-rotation
    sign, and every coefficient the results layer emits conforms to
    them.

### Identifiers allocated by this consolidation

The five below carry acceptances that arrived with no requirement id.
The allocation is recorded in the
[mapping register](../requirement-mapping.md).

!!! requirement "FR-44 Console entry-point contract <span class='srs-pending'>pending</span>"
    *Origin: the C4 acceptance, 2026-07-27, in the FULL-contract form
    she chose against the review's own recommendation of a narrower
    one.*

    The package provides four documented console entry points, one per
    operational concern, and their commands and flags change only
    under the deprecation policy of NFR-20.

    Pending, and precisely: the four entry points exist and are
    exercised, so the first half ships. The second half is the one she
    strengthened, and nothing enforces it. NFR-20 is itself pending and
    does not bind before 1.0, so today a CLI flag can change with only
    a changelog line behind it. An earlier draft of this box wrote that
    weaker form, which was the option she declined.

!!! requirement "FR-45 Strict manifest record <span class='srs-implemented'>implemented</span>"
    *Origin: the C5 acceptance, 2026-07-27. Evidence: both halves
    pinned in `tests/test_workspace.py`, the unknown-field refusal by a
    test added with this consolidation after review found the clause
    resting on a model-config line no assertion observed.*

    The manifest record rejects unknown fields and duplicate run
    identifiers; its field set is fixed and validated at construction.

!!! requirement "FR-46 Closed terminal-status set <span class='srs-implemented'>implemented</span>"
    *Origin: the C6 acceptance, 2026-07-27. Evidence: the member set
    of `RunStatus` pinned in `tests/test_workspace.py`, added with this
    consolidation; using the members, which the campaign tests do, does
    not notice an addition.*

    Every executed point terminates in exactly one value of a closed
    set of six status values, and a seventh cannot be introduced
    silently.

    Read with FR-37, which asks for a value this set does not contain.
    That collision is stated there rather than resolved here.

!!! requirement "FR-47 Public test-support assertions <span class='srs-implemented'>implemented</span>"
    *Origin: the C8 acceptance, 2026-07-27. Evidence:
    `src/pyflightstream/testing.py`; `tests/test_testing.py`.*

    The package exposes public assertion helpers that compare records
    and scripts and report the quantified violation on failure, so a
    user can assert against this package's outputs in their own tests.
