# Changelog

All notable changes to pyflightstream. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versions
follow [SemVer](https://semver.org/) and are decoupled from
FlightStream versions.

## [Unreleased]

The usage-feedback line (PLN-022): the seven workstreams triaged from
the author's first outside-the-repo use of 0.2.0, delivered 2026-07-22.

### Added

* `workspace` package (renamed from `files`): the campaign workspace
  now organizes inputs as well as outputs, with a declarative
  input-artifact library under `inputs/` (references, solver-setup
  presets, boundary groups, geometries, profiles, and an executables
  registry by build id with an explicit-override rule), output naming
  templates (`NamingTemplate`, output-only by design: the manifest
  stays the sole identity authority and no parse-back API exists),
  `CampaignWorkspace.init()` behind the new `pyfs-workspace` CLI,
  campaign pre-flight (`plan_campaign`, zero solver time), and
  resumable incremental sweeps (`run_campaign(resume=True)`).
* Entity label registry in the script builder: frames, actuators,
  motions, and boundaries can carry user labels; every entity-citing
  argument accepts index or label; `declare_existing` accepts named
  boundary inventories; boundary range checks apply once declared.
* Solver-setup provenance: `solver_settings` becomes the single entry
  point for all 28 commands of the runtime, solver, and advanced
  settings families and returns a `SolverSetup` snapshot recording
  every flag's effective value with provenance (explicit,
  evidence-backed default, or unknown, never guessed); the snapshot
  rides the run manifest and `script_from_setup` regenerates the
  script from it.
* Tabular results layer on pandas: `to_dataframe`/`to_csv` for every
  parser, `run_frame` (one wide row per run), and `sweep_frame` (the
  whole sweep from the manifest).
* The legacy run matrix as a first-class interface: `resolve_matrix`,
  `plan_matrix`, and `run_matrix` bind the matrix columns to the
  workspace input library; new `pyfs-matrix` CLI (convert, plan);
  the matrix fixture grows to eight rows.
* Two-level help: `pyflightstream.overview()` renders the
  architecture from the live module docstrings (docs Architecture
  page from the same source), and the command reference gains a
  manual-coverage section with explicit gap notes.
* `pyfs-qa cases`: the Tier 3 physics registry printed as a numbered
  test matrix.
* Command schema: optional evidence-cited default metadata.

### Changed

* `solver_settings` now requires `vorticity_drag_boundaries`
  (breaking; forgetting the selection silently zeroes the
  induced-drag accounting) and emits `SOLVER_MINIMUM_CP -100` by
  default when the flag is not passed, retiring the legacy
  reference-velocity workaround for rotor Cp clipping (override by
  passing the parameter; PHY reference re-validation queued).
* `pyflightstream.files` is deprecated in favor of
  `pyflightstream.workspace` (the shim re-exports everything with a
  DeprecationWarning for one minor release), and the
  `analysis_setup(vorticity_drag_boundaries=...)` path is deprecated
  toward `solver_settings`.
* The motivation narrative (README, docs home, SRS introduction, user
  guide) now frames version drift as the natural counterpart of an
  actively developed solver whose team is responsive and consolidates
  user requests through intermediate hotfix builds into stable
  releases, instead of reading as criticism of the changelog; the
  documented facts and citations are unchanged.

### Fixed

* `__version__` now derives from the installed metadata (the
  published 0.2.0 wheel answered `0.0.1.dev0`), and the package
  docstring no longer describes the M0 skeleton.
* The public documentation caught up with the code after a full
  staleness audit: README rewritten to the released state, docs home
  updated, all three examples rendered on the site, CONTRIBUTING
  setup corrected.

### Added (documentation and process)

* The Software Requirements Specification is published as a living
  document in the docs (`docs/srs/`): founding requirements with
  implementation statuses, the usage-feedback requirements, explicit
  non-requirements, architectural rules, standards alignment with
  verified references, and the roadmap.
* Documentation-currency policy (SRS NFR-11) with Tier 1 guards:
  version-bearing metadata files must agree, the changelog always
  carries its Unreleased section, SRS requirement ids never repeat.
* Repository top level reduced to the public essentials: the
  author's session records left Git versioning (history preserved),
  and a `deprecated/` folder now groups discontinued public items.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-22

First public release (PyPI and Zenodo). Milestones M6 (FSI) and M7
(far-field probes) landed between the tags, together with the Tier 3
matrix growth and a round of solver findings, every one backed by a
committed report.

### Added

* `fsi` subpackage (optional `[fsi]` extra, PyNiteFEA): validated
  `FsiConfig` with canonical hashing; sectional loads parser with the
  SI assertion, family-per-blade attribution with geometric
  cross-checks, and the pitch-axis to elastic-axis moment transfer;
  PyNite beam of the (w, theta) blade with exact massless-DOF
  condensation and clamped-beam benchmarks; centrifugal terms
  (tension through P-Delta, propeller moment with inner twist
  iteration) with the Campbell/Southwell verification; twist encoded
  as three-node differential translations with the exact inverse;
  node file, ordering map, and FSIDisp writer/reader from one
  generator, embedding sections at the local blade angle on spinning
  blades; four-phase coupling driver (wake, averaged relaxed
  coupling, convergence watch, unrelaxed recording) with atomic
  state, per-call freshness assertions, frozen replay mode, and a
  hash-carrying convergence log; `pyfs-fsi` executable dispatching
  between the coupled driver and the interface-evidence dummy.
* `probes` and `farfield` (far-field extraction line): serializable
  cylindrical lattice with version-aware emission; planar Cartesian
  probe grids on explicit frames with element-size and
  cosine/geometric distributions; geometry gate (optional `[geom]`
  extra) with containment culling, boundary-layer band refinement,
  and a wall standoff margin; single quadrature, azimuthal FFT
  harmonic spine, and the conservation ledgers with the synthetic G0
  gate in Tier 1; probe-export parser with the row-order contract
  check; `run.export_surface_mesh` pre-processing; `post` VTK and
  Tecplot probe-data writers.
* `qa`: PHY-05 (generic-blade unsteady periodic propeller) and
  PHY-06 (steady-versus-unsteady polar trend, 16 metrics) in the
  Tier 3 matrix with a per-version evidence gate; the `BladeSpec`
  generic propeller blade generator (public analytic shape laws).
* Command database grown from 116 to 144 entries: motion, unsteady
  solver, scenes, and advanced-settings backfill from the legacy-case
  reproduction; the mesh-import family; the Aeroelastic Coupling
  Toolbox family; per-version argument grammars
  (`versions.<v>.args`) with hotfix inheritance for the 26.1/26.12
  manual delta.
* Examples: FSI Campbell diagram and the wing static deflection
  worked cases; the beamer user guide source under `guide/`.

### Changed

* Two emission phases corrected on reproduction evidence
  (`SET_ANALYSIS_SYMMETRY_LOADS` and
  `NEW_SURFACE_SECTION_DISTRIBUTION` are in-solve consumers and
  precede `START_SOLVER`).
* `xarray` promoted to a runtime dependency (the far-field ledgers
  live on labeled arrays).

### Evidence

* FSI interface established on 26.120 build 7012026
  (`reports/RPT-005` to `RPT-007`): the implemented scripting
  interface is the Aeroelastic Coupling Toolbox family (the manual's
  `SET_MOTION_FSI` pair is unrecognized, candidate broken); the
  sectional loads export carries line densities and a three-decimal
  time-increment header (both folded back as code); the coupled loop
  ran 54/54 and 90/90 calls with the full phase machine and frozen
  replay reproducing held deformations to 5e-6.
* Probe round trip on 26.120 (`reports/RPT-004`): imported probe
  count and row order preserved exactly; boundary-layer export
  columns are geometric (erratum), motivating the standoff margin.
* PHY-05 bit-identical to its shareable-case baseline; PHY-06 polar
  trend 16 pass with monotonic steady-versus-unsteady deltas.

### Known limitations

* Two-way rotor FSI is blocked on FlightStream 26.120 build 7012026:
  the solver silently does not apply `FSIDisp.txt` morphing to
  boundaries attached to a rotary motion, while a motionless boundary
  morphs correctly with the same command sequence
  (`reports/RPT-007`; vendor report prepared). The coupling loop
  mechanics, the structural side, and the motionless path are fully
  functional.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-21

First tagged release, private phase. Everything below landed between
the repository seeding and this tag (milestones M0 through M5).

### Added

* `versions`: canonical 26.XXX version scheme with the ordered
  registry in `commands/_meta.yaml` as the only ordering authority;
  display aliases; registered manual editions (SRC-003 for 26.120,
  SRC-725 for 26.100).
* `commands`: version-aware command database, 116 commands drafted
  from the manual with a page citation each, typed argument
  specifications, script layout grammars, emission phases, and
  per-version evidence statuses (documented, verified, broken,
  removed) enforced at load time; hotfix builds inherit their base
  release record.
* `script`: builder with validating emit against the per-version
  database view, phase ordering, five layout renderers, and curated
  workflow helpers with a cross-reference ledger.
* `files` and `run`: managed campaign workspace with staging hashes
  and an append-only run manifest; local headless executor using the
  documented `-hidden --script` invocation.
* `cases`: SIM campaign model with TOML loading, recipe registry,
  campaign loop with six run statuses, and the legacy 15-column
  run-matrix reader with lossless code preservation and TOML
  round-trip conversion.
* `results`: loads and residual-history parsers with sanitized
  fixtures from real 26.120 output; version cross-check recording the
  solver-reported version and build verbatim.
* `qa`: three-tier evidence harness. Tier 2 probe suite (109 specs)
  with committed compat reports and status promotion only through
  `pyfs-qa apply-compat`; Tier 3 physics regression matrix (PHY-01
  wing polar, PHY-02 symmetry equivalence) against banded references,
  plus the cross-version drift suite with the local-only SMI class
  behind an explicit `--smi-root`; `pyfs-qa` CLI with probe,
  apply-compat, physics, drift, and update-reference.
* `reference`: single rendering source for the command reference.
  `pyflightstream.help()` writes a self-contained HTML page offline;
  the mkdocs site renders the same database into a per-chapter
  command reference and a version compatibility matrix at build time
  (nothing generated is committed).
* Docs site (mkdocs-material, strict): generated reference and
  matrix, evidence-discipline overview, and the steady polar example
  rendered from its percent-format source.
* `examples/steady_polar.py`: synthetic NACA 0012 wing, one
  version-validated script per angle, the didactic refusal for a
  version without evidence, optional solver execution behind an
  explicit executable path; executed on 26.120 build 7012026 with
  lift slope 4.83 per rad against the finite-wing anchor 5.03.

### Evidence

* 26.120 (build 7012026): 64 commands verified, 4 broken, full
  physics matrix 10 pass (`reports/compat/CMP-26120_2026-07-21_full`,
  `reports/physics/PHY-26120_2026-07-21_full`).
* 26.100 (build 5012026): 28 commands documented from the 26.1 manual
  (SRC-725), one removal; first real cross-version drift 17 pass
  1 warn (`reports/physics/DRF-26100-26120_2026-07-21_complete`); the
  warn triaged as a deterministic solver change between builds
  (`reports/physics/TRI-SMI01-CMy_2026-07-21`).
* 26.000: registered, no recorded evidence yet (honest empty column;
  backfill planned for v0.2+).
